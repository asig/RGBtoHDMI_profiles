# RGBtoHDMI_profiles

These are my profiles for RGBtoHDMI:
- `CBM_3032.txt` for a 40-cols CBM 3032, and
- `CBM_8032.txt` for an 80-cols CBM 8032.

To use the profile with your RGBtoHDMI, just store the file in the `Profiles`
directory of your SD card. 

If you use the profiles as sub-profiles, you might need to turn "Auto Switch"
off.
